# Welcome to Ahmet Tabakoglu's Progress Journal

This is my [Progress Journal website](https://bu-ie-48b.github.io/fall21-ahmettabakoglu/) created for IE 48B course at Bogazici University. Several homework assignments and projects for the course will be displayed on this page.

## Homework 1

In [this](hw1.html) homework, I manipulated and visualized a multivariate time series data gathered from an accelerometer that records data for gesture recognition.

## Homework 2

In [this](hw2.html) homework, I manipulated the training set of CBF data, applied 1D Fused Lasso and regression tree representation techniques as well as 1-NN classification method.

## Homework 3

In [this](hw3.html) homework, I chose 5 datasets, applied 2 different representation methods and calculated their distances based on 4 different methods to test their accuracies using K-NN Classification Method with cross-validation.

## Project

In [this](IE48B_Group5_Project_Report.html) project, we constructed a prediction model for system direction data in [EPİAŞ website](https://seffaflik.epias.com.tr/transparency/).
