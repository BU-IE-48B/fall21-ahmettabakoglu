# Welcome to Ahmet Tabakoglu's Progress Journal

This is my [Progress Journal website](https://bu-ie-48b.github.io/fall21-ahmettabakoglu/) created for IE 48B course at Bogazici University. Several homework assignments and projects for the course will be displayed on this page.

## Homework 1

In [this](hw1.html) homework, I manipulated and visualized a multivariate time series data gathered from an accelerometer that records data for gesture recognition.
